# CP-Bench-Open Sources

The dataset contains problems gathered from different sources.

- `aplai_course`: Problems from the APLAI course of KU Leuven, 2023-2024. As modelled here: https://github.com/kostis-init/LLM-CP-Modeling/tree/main/data/APLAI_course
  - All 18 problems are added.
- `complex_or`: Problems from the ComplexOR repository, found here: https://github.com/xzymustbexzy/Chain-of-Experts
  - Those already modelled in other folders (e.g. knapsack) and those with heavy float parameters/objective values are excluded.
- `cpmpy_examples`: Problems from the cpmpy examples folder, https://github.com/CPMpy/cpmpy/tree/master/examples
  - All included, except for the ones that require enumeration of all solutions (e.g. `solveAll`).
- `csplib`: Problems from the csplib, https://www.csplib.org/Problems/
  - For now, only the ones modelled in the cpmpy repository are included (https://github.com/CPMpy/cpmpy/tree/master/examples/csplib), and the ones modelled by Hakan Kjellerstrand (http://www.hakank.org/cpmpy/).
- `hakan_examples`: Models created by Hakan Kjellerstrand, http://www.hakank.org/cpmpy/
  - In progress with alphabetical order. Currently, includes all problems until `knights_tour_circuit.py`, excluding the following:
    - Those already modelled in other folders (e.g. aplai_course, cpmpy_examples, csplib)
    - Those that contain `solveAll` (counting solutions).
    - Global constraints tests, e.g. http://www.hakank.org/cpmpy/atmost_test.py
